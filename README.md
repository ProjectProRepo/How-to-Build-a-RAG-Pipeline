# How to Build a RAG Pipeline

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Google Colab. The pipeline processes text, web pages, and PDFs by loading the data, splitting it into chunks, embedding it, indexing it, and finally querying it for relevant information.

Make sure you have the following files ready before you start:
- `attention.pdf`
- `speech.txt` (from Nebeyou Musie's GitHub repository)

## Steps to Build the Pipeline

### Step 1: Environment Setup
First, install the necessary libraries to handle document loading, embeddings, and vector storage.

You will need to install the following libraries:
- `langchain_community`
- `pypdf`
- `chromadb`
- `sentence-transformers` and `InstructorEmbedding`

These libraries will allow you to process text, PDF, and web-based documents and work with advanced embedding models.

### Step 2: Load Text Data
In this step, you load the `speech.txt` text file into your environment. You can either upload the file manually or reference its path. 

The document loader will process the `speech.txt` file and make it ready for further analysis. This content will be used for processing and indexing in the next steps.

### Step 3: Load Data from a Web Page
In this step, you can load content directly from a web page. This is useful when working with dynamic websites. You can use a web scraping tool (like BeautifulSoup) to filter specific sections of a webpage.

For example, you could load content from a URL like `https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/` to extract relevant content. After fetching, the data will be prepared for indexing.

### Step 4: Load PDF Content
Now, you can load PDF content using the `PyPDFLoader`. You will upload the `attention.pdf` file and process it, allowing you to extract the document's content for further analysis.

This step ensures that all types of data — text, web, and PDFs — are loaded properly into your environment for indexing.

### Step 5: Split the Content into Chunks
Large documents, especially PDFs, need to be split into smaller chunks for more efficient retrieval during queries. In this step, the content is broken down into manageable chunks (for example, 1,000-character chunks with a 200-character overlap to maintain context).

This ensures that when a query is made, the retrieval process can efficiently work with smaller pieces of content while preserving the relevant information.

### Step 6: Embed and Index Data
Once the content is chunked, the next step is to embed these chunks using a model like `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` and store them in a vector store, such as Chroma, for fast similarity searches.

This step converts the content into vector embeddings, enabling the RAG pipeline to perform efficient searches for relevant information.

### Step 7: Query the Data
At this stage, you can run similarity searches over the indexed data. This allows you to ask specific questions and retrieve the most relevant pieces of information based on the embeddings.

For example, querying "Who are the authors of the Attention Is All You Need research paper?" will return the most relevant text chunks based on the query.

### Step 8: Validate the Results
Finally, ensure that the results returned from the query are accurate and relevant. If the response doesn't meet expectations, you may need to adjust parameters such as chunk size, embedding model, or search retrieval settings.

This is a critical step to refine the model and improve the accuracy of the results based on the use case.

## Next Steps
This tutorial demonstrates the essential steps to build a basic RAG pipeline, from loading and processing data to embedding, indexing, and querying. 

To fully implement a RAG pipeline for real-world deployment, you may need to explore optimization techniques, deployment, monitoring, and scaling strategies.

Now that you have the foundation of a basic RAG pipeline, you can start refining the approach by leveraging best practices and strategies for accuracy, scalability, and efficiency.
